# AWS MSK to Confluent Cloud Migration Estimator

This tool helps estimate the complexity and effort required for migrating from AWS MSK to Confluent Cloud. It provides a detailed assessment based on your current MSK setup and migration requirements.

## Scoring System

The estimator calculates a total complexity score based on 11 key categories:

   - Dedicated migration team availability

2. **Kafka Core & Data Migration** (5-25 points)
   - Number of topics and partitions
   - Topic configuration complexity
   - Historical data migration requirements
   - Acceptable downtime
   - Consumer group migration needs

3. **Applications & Connectivity** (5-20 points)
   - Number of applications
   - Programming language diversity
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Network connectivity requirements
   - Credential management

4. **Ecosystem & Tools** (5-20 points)
   - Schema Registry usage
   - Kafka Connect deployment
   - ksqlDB usage

5. **Security & Governance** (5-20 points)
   - ACL management
   - Service account complexity
   - Auditing requirements
   - Compliance needs
   - Encryption requirements

6. **Network & Connectivity** (5-20 points)
   - Network type
   - VPC peering requirements
   - PrivateLink requirements
   - Cross-region replication
   - Bandwidth and latency needs

7. **Performance & Scaling** (5-20 points)
   - Throughput requirements
   - Message size
   - Retention periods
   - Auto-scaling needs
   - Partition and broker scaling

8. **Disaster Recovery & HA** (5-25 points)
   - DR strategy
   - Backup requirements
   - Failover time requirements
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Replication factor

9. **Cost Analysis & Optimization** (5-15 points)
   - Current MSK costs
   - Cost optimization needs
   - Reserved pricing requirements
   - Data retention strategy
   - Storage type requirements

10. **Target State** (5-25 points)
    - Cluster type selection
    - Region configuration
    - Environment setup
    - Security model
    - Monitoring and logging setup
    - Automation approach
    - Compliance requirements

11. **Migration Goals** (5-20 points)
    - Primary and secondary goals
    - Timeline constraints
    - Budget constraints
    - Risk tolerance
    - Success criteria

## Risk Categorization

The total score determines the migration effort level:

- **Low Effort** (0-25 points)
  - Simple migration with minimal complexity
  - Few custom configurations
  - Standard security requirements
  - Basic monitoring needs
  - Single-region deployment
  - Limited number of applications
  - Standard retention periods
  - Basic disaster recovery needs

- **Medium Effort** (26-50 points)
  - Moderate complexity
  - Some custom configurations
  - Enhanced security requirements
  - Multiple monitoring tools
  - Multi-region considerations
  - Moderate number of applications
  - Extended retention periods
  - Standard disaster recovery

- **High Effort** (51-75 points)
  - Complex migration
  - Multiple custom configurations
  - Strict security requirements
  - Complex monitoring setup
  - Multi-region deployment
  - Large number of applications
  - Custom retention periods
  - Advanced disaster recovery

- **Very High Effort** (76+ points)
  - Extremely complex migration
  - Extensive custom configurations
  - Enterprise-grade security
  - Complex monitoring ecosystem
  - Global deployment
  - Large application ecosystem
  - Complex retention policies
  - Enterprise disaster recovery

## Recommendations

The tool provides specific recommendations based on:
